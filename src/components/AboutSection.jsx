        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        I’m Tushar - a passionate Java Full-Stack Developer with a strong foundation in building scalable, user-friendly, 
        and performance-driven applications. My journey started with a love for problem-solving and quickly evolved into 
        mastering technologies like React, Javascript, Typescript, JDBC, J2EE, HTML, CSS, MySQL, , Microsoft Power BI and Git/GitHub.
        </p>
        <p>
        I enjoy transforming ideas into real-world solutions - whether it’s developing secure web platforms, crafting 
        responsive UIs, or designing efficient databases. My projects, like “Hire a Maid” and “Smart Banking Application”, 
        reflect my ability to blend clean code with practical functionality.
        </p>
        <p>Beyond coding, I believe in continuous learning, collaboration, and writing maintainable set of codes for software that makes a difference.
          I’m always eager to learn new technologies and stay up-to-date with industry trends.
           My goal is to grow into a versatile developer who not only delivers high-quality solutions but also contributes to impactful innovations.</p>
